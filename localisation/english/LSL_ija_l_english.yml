 BRUSH_DESC:0 "Togo Heihachiro, more commonly known as Brush is the de jure leader of the Imperial Japanese Army. A respectable yet purely mature man, he was at the forefront of the empire. Handling all of the affairs, he managed to put himself on top as said before. However, his inability to contain the other cliques separated the entire Japanese empire and he ultimately fell out of favor on the main political side. Retaining the old guard however, he wasn't going to fall down without a fight, and was always prepared to hold his power.\n\nBeing the main welding point of the group, he has faced countless upbringings and downfalls from within. With his split with Felix, to his coronation as leader, to his officers factionalising themselves and to the constant raids being hit on the Japanese, he is certainly the face of the entire movement. Being a respectable, likeable and competent leader, he is certainly what some may call the de facto Tojo Hideki of the empire. With his upbringing consisting of first joining Emperor Gaini at the formation of his empire, he rose through the ranks slowly yet surely. He made lightning progress, and was eventually named leader when Gaini stepped down. There, he oversaw the ENTIRE empire, lasting from island to island and city by city. He organised raids, tied up loose ends and ultimately made the empire what it was at the forefront.However, all good things came to an end. Rampant factionalism saw afoot as the Korean peninsula fell under Richterist control. Brush used this opportunity for revanchist propaganda, however the consequences of such resulted in rampant factionalism not seen before."
 MURNAU_DESC:0 "Murnau 'Zacc' Zamasu is a minor noble and the owner of the Murnau Military Arms Manufacturer. With his entire childhood spent in Northern Elbe, Murnau always dreamt about being one of the great conquerors in history. With a scandal errupting in Northern Elbe seeing him being exiled, he'd had returned to Japan in the late 1920s. Instead of joining the military however, he took an interest in the corporate side of ROBLOX, finding his specialty in weapon manufacturing. Young Murnau would find himself competing with another arms manufacturer in which is dominating the market, the one and only Viethin. However, Murnau had 1 upside that Viethin could not counter. A non-glitchy system. MurnauFE's system was flawless, it was clean, smooth and it certainly did not lag. It became a favorite, notably with Alemannia who had commissioned people to make HUNDREDS of animations of MurnauFE. His business had become a giant success and after the failure of the Imperial Japanese Army in Korea, Murnau slowly stepped into the world of politics. With the Old Guard and Murnau despising eachother mutually, he sought the moment to strike and to later then proclaim the great Empire of the Pacific."
 FELIX_DESC:0 "Papa Hokkaido, commonly referred to as ManFelix is a very intriguing person. Many would say that he's ignorant, many would follow his personality cult, many would claim he's incompetent and many would say that he's a humorous guy simply looking for fun. Regardless, he is undoubtedly the spirit of the IJA. Under his authority, cracks in the army and the political spectrum of group have proven laxed by Felix, as he turns to look the other way when certain cases of a reckless army pop up. Unprofessionality rampant, Felix does not care about the state of his armed forces. Being negligent towards the progression of competency within his army, this has formed multiple spills in his group yet notably his personality cult covers it all up, proving to only being loyal dogs to the giant hog."
 
### Ideas ###
 remnants_of_the_old_community:0 "Remnants of the Old Community"
 remnants_of_the_old_community_desc:1 "The IJA has had a long haul of history on its time on ROBLOX. With many of its members being veterans, it manages to stay with its imperial roots lasting from when it was first founded, to the rampant factionalism and both the rises and falls of certain figures, leaders and generals. This brings stability in the IJA, as all of the old guard are able to stay united under 1 leader, being able to follow orders when commanded by one, and being a strong reminder of the communities founding, good hope and its future. Brining stability to the nation, it makes leadership more smooth, able and overall firm."
 growing_factionalism:0 "Growing Factionalism"
 growing_factionalism_desc:0 "With instability growing throughout the IJA, factionalism on the isles had occured. With the 2 main figures being Brush and Felix, many "lower" yet ambitious characters have arisen, taking advantage of the constant civil war. These include Based and Murnau, managing to propel themselves from their own former communities and taking power. Brush was a mature and historical character, looking for the success in the roots of the IJA while disciplining it harshly, making it a viable fighting force. Felix was a fun and interesting character, however unfortunately building a character cult around himself to secure stability in his inner-circle while being an extremely active ROBLOX character. Murnau was a famed gun developer, running one of the largest weapon systems in all of ROBLOX, his gun MurnauFE ranging from Alemannia to lower level groups like Zusten, Dietsland, Edelkara and so on. And finally there was Based. An isolationist character, he wasn't fairly involved in the politics and war that ROBLOX brought. He was inactive, however, and this gave way for Murnau to grow."
 loss_of_korea:0 "Loss of Korea"
 loss_of_korea_desc:0 "The IJA has experienced its fair share of downfalls. With the Richters managing to seize Korea in a violent and brutal revolution, the Imperials faced their first lost. Keeping up with Revanchist thought, the Richters are forced to defend its roots as the awakening Far-Eastern giant is preparing to attack the apparent "super-state" to its last man standing."
 isles_in_isolation:0 "Isles in Isolation"
 isles_in_isolation_desc:0 "Based believed in an isolated Far-East. Refusing to get involved in ROBLOX politics, he managed to bring in the plague and rot that is known as inactivity. Based being himself inactive managed to pass down this virus to Murnau, who was inactive yet brought up a large army in what was known as the Empire of the Pacific. Murnau was an outcast, however, and had no choice but to remain in isolation."
 self_sufficiency:0 "Self Sufficiency"
 self_sufficiency_desc:0 "The Far-Eastern isles have seen their fair share of development. Sustaining great developers, they ensure their games are superior, on-top and overall perfected. This brings way for more advanced combat and training, while the overall aesthetic manages to give a great vibe and view for all that play. Without the need to outsource, commission and contract developers, self sufficiency is definitely a feet that the IJA has achieved."

 IJA_the_empire_strikes_back_desc:0 "For quite a while the Richters maintained security and control over the Korean peninsula. The IJA, losing Korea to a brutal revolution masterminded by the Richterian family, has for some time continued revanchist thoughts to 'resecure' the peninsula. This vengeance thought has been implemented in the minds of the Japanese people, as it becomes an ideological promise to liberate the Korean enclave."
