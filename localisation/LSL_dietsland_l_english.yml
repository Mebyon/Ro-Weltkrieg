 carantanian_patriarch:1 "Carantanian Patriarch"
 EMANUEL_DESC:0 "The Grand Prince of Orange of ROBLOX, usually called Emannuel Fremwell and sometimes known as Ludo. He was the founder of the rich, Highland dynasty known as the Fremwells. Architecting the modern day Flanders-Dutch state known as Dietsland, his members have been seen spread about not only the Ro-WW2 genre but also the site as a whole.\nEmannuel was born to humble upbringings, with nobility and using this powerful jump-start, he was proclaimed the practical Prince of Orange of ROBLOX. He formed the Fremwell dynasty and its trading empire, then founding the nation known as Dietsland. Ludo from there invited many businesses, factions, parties and corporations, such notable divisions including the LVF, there run by Lakeland, the Renault Organization, run by the profound Frenchie JeanLattre, the Kenver Corporation, the business side of the Kenver family and so many more. Many parties arose, too, as Heftigs from Israel and Poland fled in an Aliyah case to Dietsland, Falangists of the SEU arose, the Strasserite James began his party after Burgundy flopped, the Eberlings made a Vonckist party and Degrelles had formed the Rexist party, attracting even Hellernsteit to the cause. Many families were brought into the mix, too, with the Kenvers, Renaults, Eberlings, Richterians, Renaults, Mannerheims, Haugwitz, Oswalds and many other joining into the mix too.\nThis formed the foundations of an unstable state with elections promised however never brung as the spring of constant conflict occured day and night. Civilian massacres by the LVF, razings by the Heftigs, the brave defenders of Oskar209's Free Volunteer Force and the Royalist Division raised by faithful civilians, the Rexists aiding in the defense, the Strassers remaining on 1 side of the river and the police doing nothing, it was an unstable mess and now Emannuel was returning to refound not only Dietsland, but his family."

### Ideas ###
 political_violence:0 "Political Violence"
 political_violence_desc:0 "Political violence has always been an issue. However, with the introduction of more militant groups into the variety of political organisations, grievances between such organisations have devolved into open violence. Futile attempts by the Patriarch have proven unsuccessful, as increased army and police response times have continued to be useless. With many buildings and street heads falling to opposing factions, the political future of Dietsland is still unsure."
 weak_army:0 "A Weak and Inactive Army"
 weak_army_desc: "With the unprecedented presence of paramiltary forces within Dietsland, the Homeguard has always been on the backfoot when it comes to professionalism and up-to-date equipment. Despite this, however, the military head, CadorKenver, does his best to maintain control as opposing forces not only strike at his state, but also his weak army. With constant violence and conflict, the army has been worn out and is only held together by parties and factions."
 unstable_government:0 "Unstable Government"
 unstable_government_desc:0 "Due to the political nature of the nation, civilian governments tend to have a small lifespan, usually being overthrown by another faction within the country. Elections have been attempted yet they've failed as terrorists boycott elections each month."
 vorstenbond_league:0 "Vorstenbond League"
 vorstenbond_league_desc:0 "The Royal Family of Dietsland and its beloved Patriarch have been a staple point all through-out. It continues to keep its connections with other royal bloodlines and dynasties across the platform, yet it is also forced to maintain relations at home. Stuck with competent yet inactive members, it manages to keep control by a string."
